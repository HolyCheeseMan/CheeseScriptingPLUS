[Installer.exe](https://github.com/HolyCheeseMan/CheeseScriptingPLUS/blob/Main/Installer%20(.exe)/Installer.exe)

**This file IS completely safe, however some problems are below:**

This file was packaged via **pyinstaller** which is often used by python viruses to go to exe form so you can read whats inside. The reason this is bad for our Installer.exe is because it means it uses a very similar exe build to these virus, causing false-positives in many anti-virus software. This is a very common thing with pyinstaller .exe files and there is very little to fix it. Source code of this .exe is [here](https://github.com/HolyCheeseMan/CheeseScriptingPLUS/blob/Main/APP/Source%20Code/Installer.py) But it takes a while to set up all of the 'pip's it requires.

We are very sorry for this incovenience, but if you really want to run this file you may have to turn off your anti-virus software which is too much of a hasle so that is why we have a .bat form which is faster than this .exe but just doesnt look as nice.

Please contact me if things have changed and the .exe is usable by google. Thanks!
