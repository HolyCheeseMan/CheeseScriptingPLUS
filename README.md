# Warning!

If you have scanned this file with Virus Total, you may have seen this: ([Pyinstaller False Positives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C38uN7xdaZo))

These are false positives, the python file (soure code here: [Source Code](https://github.com/HolyCheeseMan/CheeseScriptingPLUS/tree/Main/APP/Source%20Code) ) is safe but was converted to exe with pyinstaller for simplicity of installation. You can still run the installer.py and be fine. 
Reasons that these false positives show up can be: 
- How PyInstaller packages the code. When PyInstaller packages the code it can sometimes obfuscate it, leading to false positives.
- Many Python-based viruses use pyinstaller to format into exe. Virus total now gives false positives to normal scripts because they use a similar exe build.
